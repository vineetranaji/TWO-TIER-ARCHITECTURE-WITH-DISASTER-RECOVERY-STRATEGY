Infra Builld through Terraform:
• Creating terraform code for IAM role
• Creating EC2-instance
• Creating VPC and security group for network configurations
• Creating SNS topic for notification service
• Creating Backup vault and plan
• Creating KMS key for encryption
• Creating S3 bucket for storage

Brief about AWS Services:
1. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Role: Manages access to AWS resources, ensuring only authorized users and applications can interact with them.
Components: Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies define access levels and permissions.
Application: Assigns roles to EC2 for secure access to S3 without hard-coded credentials, and controls S3 and Backup access.

2. Security Group
Role: Acts as a firewall, controlling network traffic to AWS resources.
Components: Inbound and outbound rules, and stateful filtering.
Application: Protects EC2 by restricting traffic types (e.g., HTTP), and secures data flow by limiting access to resources.

3. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Role: Provides virtual servers for running applications.
Components: Instance types, storage, Elastic IPs, and AMIs.
Application: Hosts the application server, interacts with S3, uses roles for access, and is monitored for scaling.

4. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Role: Scalable storage for application data, backups, and static assets.
Components: Buckets, objects, storage classes, and access control.
Application: Stores application data and backups, encrypted with KMS, with controlled access via IAM.

5. AWS Backup
Role: Automates data backup across AWS services.
Components: Backup plans, vaults, cross-region backups, and recovery points.
Application: Schedules automatic backups, stores them in vaults, and enables disaster recovery.

6. SNS (Simple Notification Service)
Role: Sends notifications for system events.
Components: Topics, subscriptions, message filtering, and delivery.
Application: Alerts for backup completions or CloudWatch alarms, enabling quick response to events.

7. KMS (Key Management Service)
Role: Manages encryption keys for data security.
Components: CMKs, data keys, key policies, and automatic key rotation.
Application: Encrypts data in S3 and backups, with access control for secure decryption and auditing.

8. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Role: Creates isolated networks for AWS resources.
Components: Subnets, route tables, internet/NAT gateways, security groups, ACLs.
Application: Separates web and database servers, controls traffic, and enables high availability across zones.
