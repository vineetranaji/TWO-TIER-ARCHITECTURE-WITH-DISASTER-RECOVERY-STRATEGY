Hardware Requirements:
The t2.micro instance type in Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 is part of the T2 family, which provides a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline when needed. 
Here's a breakdown of its hardware specifications:
EC2 Instance Type: t2.micro
1. Processor:
• vCPUs: 1 vCPU

2. Memory:
• RAM: 1 GiB (Gigabyte)

3. Disk Space:
• Instance Store: No instance store is provided for t2.micro.
• Elastic Block Store (EBS): You can attach EBS volumes to t2.micro instances. The size and type of these volumes can vary depending on your needs (e.g., General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, etc.).

Note: The root EBS volume is typically 8 GiB by default, but you can customize the size when launching the instance.

Additional Information:
• Network Performance: Low to Moderate.
• Burstable Performance: t2.micro instances earn CPU credits when they are idle, and these credits can be used to burst up to full CPU core performance for a short time when needed.

Use Cases:
• Suitable for low-traffic web servers, small databases, or development and testing environments where a small, low-cost instance is needed.
The t2.micro instance type is a cost-effective choice for lightweight applications that require occasional bursts of CPU power but don't need a lot of memory or persistent high CPU performance.

Suggested:
You might need to use larger values that are appropriate for your production/real-time environment.

Operating System:
All supported Windows operating systems
