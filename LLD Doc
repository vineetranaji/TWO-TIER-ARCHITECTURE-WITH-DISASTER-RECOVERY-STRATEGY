Low-Level Design (LLD) Document for Two-Tier Architecture with Disaster Recovery on AWS


1.	Introduction
-	Project Overview: Implementation of a two-tier architecture using AWS for disaster recovery.
-	Objective: Ensure data integrity, and disaster recovery using AWS and DevOps tools.


2.	System Architecture Design:
 
-	Architecture Overview:
-	Two-tier architecture: Application tier on EC2 instances and data tier on S3.
-	Disaster recovery setup with backup and restore using AWS Backup.
 
-	Components and AWS Services:
-	EC2 Instances: Hosts application server.
-	S3 Bucket: Stores data and logs, with versioning for data integrity.
-	AWS Backup: Automates backup and cross-region data replication.
-	SNS: Sends notifications for backup events.


3.	Detailed Component Design
-	EC2 Instance:
-	Name: application-server
- instance id: i-01520581279902795
-	public DNS: ec2-3-110-204-208.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
-	Instance Type: t2.micro for testing, scalable in production.
-	Operating System: Windows 2019.
-	IAM Role: Assigned for secure access to S3 [name = ec2s3accessrole]
-SG attached: sg-0b206759788b34359


-	S3 Bucket:
-	Name: mtechproj
-Se bucket ARN: arn:aws:s3:::mtechproj
-	Bucket Configuration: Enabled with versioning, daily backups.
-	Data Storage: Uses S3 Standard storage class.


-	AWS Backup:
-	Backup Plan: Defined policies for backup frequency and retention. [name = backup- plan]
- Backup Plan id: 4c3fdc33-3802-4a85-a8be-2b8ba036007b
-	Backup rule name: backup-rule
-	Resource assignment: backup-sns-s3
-	Backup Vault: Cross-region replication for disaster recovery. [name = backup_vault]
-Vault ARN: arn:aws:backup:ap-south-1:851725542166:backup-vault:backup_vault
- KMS id: 216eec37-13aa-48ad-96b6-aff4e5f0271b
-	IAM Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::851725542166:role/BackupS3AccessRole
 

// Cross Region Backup:
-	Region: us-east-1
-	Vault ARN: arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:851725542166:backup-vault:backup_vault


-	SNS (Simple Notification Service):
-	Notification Setup: Trigger notifications on backup events.
-	Topic Name: BackupJobNotifications
-	ARN: arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:851725542166:BackupJobNotifications
-	IAM role: arn:aws:iam::851725542166:role/BackupS3AccessRole
-	Endpoint: mukkapriyanka903@gmail.com


4.	Disaster Recovery and Backup Process
-	Backup Frequency: Daily backups retained for 35 days.
-	Disaster Recovery:
-	Cross-region backups in Virginia for data redundancy.
-	Restore process for selective file or entire bucket.


5.	Security and Access Management
-	IAM Roles and Policies:
-	Policies for EC2-S3 access: arn:aws:iam::851725542166:role/ec2s3accessrole
-	backup-related permissions: arn:aws:iam::851725542166:role/BackupS3AccessRole


-	Security Groups:
-	Ingress and egress rules configured for EC2 instances.
- SG ID: sg-0b206759788b34359


-	KMS (Key Management Service):
-	Encryption keys for S3 data and backup data.
- KMS ARN: arn:aws:kms:ap-south-1:851725542166:key/216eec37-13aa-48ad-96b6- aff4e5f0271b
-	alias name: kms-alias
 
6.	CI/CD Pipeline:
-	Jenkins Pipeline:
- Code deployment setup.
-	GitHub Integration: Stores infrastructure code managed via Terraform.


7.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:
-	Terraform Configuration:
-	Providers and Modules: AWS provider setup for EC2, S3, IAM, Backup, etc.
-	Resource Definitions: S3 bucket, EC2 instance, IAM policies, SNS, and KMS configurations.
-	Sample Code Snippets:
-	S3 Bucket Configuration:
-	Example Terraform code for S3 bucket creation with versioning.
-	EC2 Instance Configuration:
-	Example for defining EC2 instance parameters.


8.	Testing and Validation:
-	Functional Testing:
-	Validation of backup schedules, disaster recovery.
-	Performance Testing:
-	Backup and restore operation validation.
-	Compliance and Security Testing:
-	Access control, encryption, and logging verification.


9.	Logging and Monitoring
-	CloudWatch and SNS Integration:
-	Logs for backup events and data integrity checks.
-	PowerShell Scripts:
-	Script for website status check and log sync to S3.
 
10.	Conclusion and Recommendations
-	In conclusion, the architecture successfully balances performance, resilience, and security. With ongoing monitoring, testing, and improvements, this solution will remain well- aligned with evolving business and technical requirements.
-	Future Improvements: Recommendations for scaling or optimizing DR and backup strategies.
