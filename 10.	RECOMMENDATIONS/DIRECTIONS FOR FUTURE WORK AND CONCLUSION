RECOMMENDATIONS/DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK:
•	Need to Automate the tasks required to place the scripts inside server with Ansible or Puppet DevOps Tools.
•	When this plan is used in real time projects, need few modifications accordingly.
•	Review and optimize resource usage to ensure cost efficiency, particularly with EC2 instance types and backup retention policies.
•	As AWS releases new services or updates existing ones, consider incorporating these into the architecture to further improve security, scalability, and cost efficiency.
•	Periodic security audits and IAM role reviews can help maintain a secure environment. Implement a policy for quarterly IAM role and permission reviews to prevent privilege creep and ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.


CONCLUSION:


The detailed design and implementation of this AWS two-tier architecture ensure the application is secure, scalable, and resilient to failures. By integrating DevOps best practices and utilizing AWS services, the architecture supports continuous delivery for streamlined updates, automated backups for data protection, and a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of an incident. These features align with the project’s objectives to prioritize data integrity and system reliability, ensuring the application remains dependable and responsive to user needs.
